# MyManager
This code is meant as a piece of software, a manager, for those who sell online, specifically with clothes.  There are many clothes selling sites out there: Depop, Grailed, Ebay, Poshmark, Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Vinted, etc.  I am currently running an online store which nets good money but is very time consuming physically with sourcing and shipping items, I rarely can find time to spend a few hours just mindlessly posting the same few items onto every single other of these sites, one by one.  So this is to help with that.  THis "Manager" is an all in one tool for you store designed to maximize efficiency and save you countless hours that you can then spend doing whatever you wish.  By functions that this program can do are...
- Post new items onto every single platform with the click of a button and a template
- Scrape an existing inventory from one program and post exact copies onto other programs
- Scrape active inventory and sold inventory to give you more insight on your store sales and inventory
- Visualize that to pinpoint the key performance indicators and maximize your store efficiency
- Do other small automative tasks automatically like: Follow and unfollow users, relist items, discount items, send feedback, notify you of messages, send offers, etc...
- Gives you the ability to orgnaize your store page on sites like Depop to however you wish, for users to see how you'd intend them to
- Can replace the background of your images with a more professional background
- Best of all, puts all this information into an easy to use application where users can access all different programs in the same window.

As of now, have only done part of Depop, Grailed, Ebay and Poshmark but plan to expand to every single selling site possible.
